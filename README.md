# Resume-Recommendation-System
The goal of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to assist recruiters in quickly processing resumes and identifying top candidates for job openings. The motivation behind the project is to help reduce the time and effort needed to screen resumes and provide a more efficient recruitment process.
